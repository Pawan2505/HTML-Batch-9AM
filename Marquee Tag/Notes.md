### ðŸ““ Marquee Tag:

**1. What is `<marquee>`?**
The `<marquee>` tag is an old HTML tag that we use to move text or images across the screen. Basically, it creates a moving effect like scrolling, sliding, or bouncing text.

**2. Why do we use it?**
We use it to grab attention on something â€” like announcements, headlines, offers, or any important message.

**3. Note:**
Even though it's cool and fun to use, `<marquee>` is **not officially supported in HTML5**. That means modern developers usually avoid it and prefer CSS/JS for animations. But for learning or fun projects, itâ€™s still fine!

<marquee direction="right">Moving to the right</marquee>
```

### Note:

* Donâ€™t use it in serious/professional websites â€” just for learning and fun.
* For real projects, use CSS animations or JavaScript instead.
