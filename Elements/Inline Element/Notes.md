## ðŸ“˜ HTML Inline Elements

### ðŸ”¹ What is an Inline Element?

Inline elements **do not start from a new line**.
They **take only as much width as needed** â€” unlike block elements which take the full width.

### Common Inline Tags:

---

### 1. `<span>`

Used as a generic inline container â€” helpful when we want to style **a part of text** inside a paragraph.

```html
<span>This is span text</span>
```

---

### 2. `<b>`

Stands for "bold". It **makes the text bold**, but doesnâ€™t add semantic importance.

```html
<b>This is bold</b>
```

---

### 3. `<i>`

It **makes the text italic**, used mostly for stylistic purposes.

```html
<i>This is italic</i>
```

---

### 4. `<strong>`

This also **makes the text bold**, but it means the text is **important**. (semantic meaning)

```html
<strong>Important text</strong>
```

---

### 5. `<em>`

It also italicizes text, but it means the text is **emphasized**. (semantic meaning)

```html
<em>Emphasized text</em>
```

---

### 6. `<small>`

It displays **smaller** text than normal.

```html
<small>This is small text</small>
```

---

### 7. `<big>`

It displays **slightly bigger** text than normal.

```html
<big>This is big text</big>
```

---

### 8. `<sub>` and `<sup>`

* `<sub>` is for **subscript** (goes below). Used in chemical formulas like Hâ‚‚O.
* `<sup>` is for **superscript** (goes above). Used in math like 2Â².

```html
H<sub>2</sub>O | 3<sup>2</sup>
```

---

### 9. `<u>`

This **underlines** the text.

```html
<u>Underlined text</u>
```

---

### 10. `<mark>`

It **highlights** the text with yellow color.

```html
<mark>Highlighted text</mark>
```

---

### 11. `<del>` and `<ins>`

* `<del>` shows **deleted text** (strikethrough).
* `<ins>` shows **inserted text** (usually underlined).

```html
<del>Old Text</del>  
<ins>New Text</ins>
```
